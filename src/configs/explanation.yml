      Precision measures the percentage of items that are correctly identified as 
      positive out of all items that the model identified as positive. In other words, 
      it measures the proportion of true positives among all the samples that the 
      model classified as positive. A high precision means that the model is 
      good at avoiding false positives.

      Recall measures the percentage of all positive items that are correctly identified 
      by the model. In other words, it measures the proportion of true positives 
      that the model correctly identified among all the samples that are actually 
      positive. A high recall means that the model is good at avoiding false negatives.
