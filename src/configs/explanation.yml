  precision:
    title: Precision
    label: 📏 $P = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$ 📏
    subheader: A high precision means our model is good at avoiding false positives.
    text: >
      Precision measures the percentage of items that are correctly identified as 
      positive out of all items that the model identified as positive. In other words, 
      it measures the proportion of true positives among all the samples that the 
      model classified as positive. A high precision means that the model is 
      good at avoiding false positives.
  recall:
    title: Recall
    label: 📞 $R = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$ ☎️
    subheader: A high recall means that our mode is good at avoiding false negatives.

      Recall measures the percentage of all positive items that are correctly identified 
      by the model. In other words, it measures the proportion of true positives 
      that the model correctly identified among all the samples that are actually 
      positive. A high recall means that the model is good at avoiding false negatives.
  accuracy:
    title: Accuracy
    label: 👉🎯
    subheader: While our models is accurate on TPs, it cannot predict any TN correctly.
    text: >
      Accuracy is a metric used to evaluate how well a classification model is able 
      to correctly predict the class label of unseen data points, and it is defined 
      as the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. 
  f1_score:
    title: F1 Score
    label: $f1 = \frac{2 tp}{2tp + fp + fn}$🏎️
    subheader: The higher the score the better the performance on our imbalanced data.
    text: >
      The F1 score is a measure of a model's accuracy that combines the precision 
      and recall metrics into a single score. It takes into account both false 
      positives and false negatives, making it a useful metric for evaluating models 
      that deal with imbalanced classes.
  specificity:
    title: Specificity
    label: $S = \frac{tn}{tn + fp}$ 💪👀

      Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in 
      laying out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is attributed to an
      unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled 
      parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen
      book. It usually begins with.
